features:
  - |
    Circuit context returns the classical register together with ``QuantumRegister``. The two
    registers are contained within a tuple and are returned as ``with circuit.context as (q, c)``,
    instead of ``with circuit.context as q``.

    .. code-block:: python

      circuit = Circuit(2, 2)

      with circuit.context as (q, c):
          ops.X(q[0])

upgrade:
  - |
    Update context to return a ``NamedTuple`` instead of a regular tuple, allowing for the registers
    to be returned as previously, directly unpacked into ``q`` and ``c``, or as a named ``Registers``
    tuple and retrieved via ``Registers.q`` and ``Registers.c`` respectively.
  - |
    Update parametric context to return a ``NamedTuple`` instead of a regular tuple similar to the
    non-parametric context upgrade, with the parameter register accessed via ``Registers.p``.

    .. code-block:: python

      circuit = ParametricCircuit(2, 2)

      with circuit.context as reg:
          ops.RX(reg.p[0], reg.q[0])
