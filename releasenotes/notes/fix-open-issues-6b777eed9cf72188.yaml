    Check types when adding qubits/bits to a circuit and raise a ``TypeError`` if an incorrect type
    is passed to the method.
  - Rename ``label`` to ``name`` for operations.
fixes:
  - Fix inconsistent spacing in primitive object representations.
  - Fix sequential qubit/bit labelling when adding new registers.
  - Update operation representations to use ``repr()`` for hashables.
